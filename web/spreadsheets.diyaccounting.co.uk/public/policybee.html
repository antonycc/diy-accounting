          <h2>Who needs business insurance?</h2>
          <p class="product-description">
            If you provide professional advice or services, work on client premises, employ staff, or have business equipment, you likely
            need insurance. Some clients and contracts require proof of cover before you can start work. Employers' liability insurance is a
            legal requirement if you have one or more employees.
