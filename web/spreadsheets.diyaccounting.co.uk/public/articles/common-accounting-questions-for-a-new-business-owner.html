        <h2>Common Accounting Questions for a New Business Owner</h2>
        <p>
          Starting you own business brings in a lot of new concepts and terms. Here is a quick run through some of those we regularly
          encounter from new business owners.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What is the difference between: Turnover, Net Profit and Gross Profit?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Turnover:</strong> the amount of money taken by a business in a particular period.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Net Profit:</strong> the actual profit after working expenses not included in the calculation of gross profit have been
          paid
        </p>
        <p><strong>Gross Profit</strong>: a company’s residual (left over) profit after selling a product</p>
        <p><strong>What is the difference between: Management Accounts and Financial Accounts?</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Management Accounts:</strong> is concerned with the provisions and use of accounting information to managers within
          organizations, to provide them with the basis to make informed business decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Financial accounting</strong>: is the field of accountancy concerned with the preparation of financial statements for
          decision makers, such as stockholders, suppliers, banks, employees, government agencies, owners, and other stakeholders
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What is a Balance Sheet?</strong> A financial statement that summarizes a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders'
          equity at a specific point in time. These three balance sheet segments give investors an idea as to what the company owns and
          owes, as well as the amount invested by the shareholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Assets</strong> - In the context of accounting, assets are either current or fixed (non-current). Current means that the
          asset will be consumed within one year. Generally, this includes things like cash, accounts receivable and inventory. Fixed assets
          are those that are expected to keep providing benefit for more than one year, such as equipment, buildings and real estate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Liabilities</strong> - Recorded on the balance sheet (right side), liabilities include loans, accounts payable, mortgages,
          deferred revenues and accrued expenses. Liabilities are a vital aspect of a company's operations because they are used to finance
          operations and pay for large expansions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What are the benefits of forming a limited company over self-employment?</strong> A limited company can bring tax savings,
          as you are able to take a dividend instead of simply taking a slice of company income home, as you would have done in
          self-employment. And it might even change the way clients look at you .e.g. introducing yourself as director. People may also take
          the company more seriously.
        </p>
        <p><strong>When do you need to register for VAT in the UK?</strong></p>
        <p>
          A business must register for VAT if its taxable turnover for any consecutive 12-month period exceeds the VAT registration
          threshold. The current VAT registration threshold is <strong>£81,000</strong> but this tends to increase every year.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What is the difference between depreciation and capital allowances?</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Capital allowance</strong> refers to sums of money a UK business can deduct from the overall corporate or income tax on
          its profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tax depreciation</strong> is the depreciation that can be listed as an expense on a tax return for a given reporting
          period under the applicable tax laws.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Depreciation</strong> is the gradual charging to expense of a fixed asset's cost over its useful life</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Who needs to submit a CT600?</strong> The company submits the CT600 however a employee may submit the CT600 on behalf of
          the company.
        </p>
