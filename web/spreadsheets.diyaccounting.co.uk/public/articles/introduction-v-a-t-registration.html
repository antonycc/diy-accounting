        <h2>Introduction VAT Registration</h2>
        <p>
          When the sales turnover of a business reaches the vat threshold, currently
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF001"
            >£90,000 per annum (from April 2024)<sup><a href="../references.html#REF001">[1]</a></sup></span
          >, then
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF003"
            >registration for vat is compulsory<sup><a href="../references.html#REF003">[2]</a></sup></span
          >. If financially beneficial, businesses can register for vat prior to sales turnover reaching the vat threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a business registers for vat it becomes responsible for charging vat at the correct percentage on every sales invoice and
          transfer of goods and services and also maintaining accurate financial accounting records of the vat charged hat are subject to
          vat inspections. If the sales turnover has breached the vat threshold that business is liable for the vat on sales even if it has
          not charged the customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vat charged to customers is called output tax and the vat on purchases is called input tax. When a business has registered for
          vat in addition to maintaining records of sales and input tax it must also keep accurate financial records of purchases and input
          tax in order to calculate the vat payment to be made. The amount of vat to be paid each quarter is the difference between the
          sales output tax and the purchases input tax and is paid quarterly to HMRC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specific types of business transactions are exempt from vat such as insurance and loans. If the business only supplies exempt
          items then the business cannot register for vat to reclaim the input tax paid on purchases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Registering voluntarily for vat when the sales turnover is below the vat threshold is a financial planning decision that each
          small business should consider. There are both advantages and disadvantages to a voluntary registration and the timing of the
          registration may also be a feature to be taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantages include being able to reclaim the vat input on purchases which is otherwise lost as a financial cost to the
          business. However as a consequence of a voluntary vat registration that business would also have to charge vat on all its sales
          invoices.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the business has mainly vat registered clients then charging vat would probably not affect sales volume and has the advantage
          of enhanced credibility within the business community in which it operates. Charging vat to non registered clients such as members
          of the public would increase the amount being charged and make the small business less competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a business moves from being non vat registered to being vat registered changes may have to be made to the bookkeeping records
          being maintained. Not normally a problem if accounting or bookkeeping software is being used provided the financial system
          employed can fulfil the enhanced requirements being vat registered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accounting requirements of being vat registered require the business to issue vat invoices which show the name and address of
          the business, the vat registration number, sales invoice date and the vat being charged. An accounting record must be kept of all
          sales invoices issued in a format that permits a subsequent audit check when the customs and excise visit to conduct an audit
          check of the vat records.
        </p>
        <p>
          In relation to purchase invoices and reclaiming the vat input tax vat may only be reclaimed on those invoices for which the
          business has a vat purchase invoice. A valid vat purchase invoice contains the vat number of the supplier who issued the invoice.
          An accounting record must be kept of all purchase invoices showing the vat output tax being reclaimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vat returns are normally required to be prepared on a quarterly basis and submitting to customs and excise before the end of the
          following month. Since April 2022,
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF004"
            >all VAT-registered businesses must submit VAT returns digitally through Making Tax Digital<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF004">[3]</a></sup
            ></span
          >. There are benefits to filing the tax return online in that many businesses may receive up to 7 days longer than normal to file
          the vat return if the vat payment is being made electronically.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are penalties for failing to submit the vat tax return on time and interest may be charged on the outstanding amount. When a
          vat return is not submitted on time an assessment may be raised which has to be paid as a legal debt until such time as the return
          is submitted and the amount due corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to submit the quarterly tax return on time even if there is a problem paying the full amount. Failing to submit on
          time brings the business to the attention of the tax authority that is more likely to inspect and investigate persistent
          offenders. A business can be expected to receive an inspection every three years however in the worst case scenario of a
          delinquent vat registered business the customs and excise could inspect every quarter.
