        <h2>Small Business Accounting Software Selection Improves Financial Control</h2>
        <p>
          Maintaining accounting records can be difficult for any business, especially self employed and small business organisations where
          a lack of accounting knowledge can be prohibitive. Selecting the right accounting software for your business can seriously improve
          financial performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best choice is often dependent upon the size of the business and the employment of full time accountants, accounting staff,
          bookkeepers or management of the accounting records by the proprietor. Every business needs to choose the most appropriate
          accounts package according to both the requirements of the business and the capabilities of the person or people who will operate
          the accounting solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many small businesses do not benefit from sophisticated accounting software if the technical requirements of that software exceed
          the abilities of the users to produce efficient financial records and use the full capabilities of the accounting software to
          maintain a high level of financial control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively a simple bookkeeping package may not offer the degree of financial control over such financial matters as debtors
          and credit control, creditors and cash flow liquidity that may be required. Financial control and cash flow is of supreme
          significance and importance when credit is tight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every business needs to maintain a set of books and accounts to satisfy the legal obligations to calculate the net taxable profit
          which has to be both declared to the taxation authority and provide sufficient financial records to support that calculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until the mid twentieth century it was common practise to produce accounts handwritten on paper, Typing being reserved for the
          final set of accounts for publication as required. Handwritten accounting records are largely obsolete for medium and larger
          businesses although still used by many small business organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the advent of computers accounting software has become the norm and there are many simple bookkeeping packages that can be
          easy to understand and offer sufficient levels of financial control for even the smallest business.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence each small business has a choice between preparing a handwritten set of accounts, using a simple bookkeeping package
          which could be based upon bookkeeping spreadsheets or a more sophisticated accounting software package that almost invariably use
          a data entry system into a database which can then be queried to produce the required financial control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing handwritten accounts would only be applicable to the smallest business where the proprietor had no employees, limited
          numbers of transactions and had full financial control without the need for written information. Such handwritten accounts would
          not be suitable for any business that required control over debtors and creditors or that needed to produce a balance sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those businesses that could suffice with handwritten accounts there are better options available such as using computer
          spreadsheets. Minimal knowledge would be required and the benefits substantial compared with being handwritten.
        </p>
        <p>
          An accounting package based upon computer spreadsheets is suitable for most small business as it can be no more difficult than
          maintaining handwritten accounts but in an organised format. The sophistication of the format would be according to the ability of
          the designer of the accounting solution or the bookkeeping knowledge of the person preparing the accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accounting software written on a computer accounting spreadsheet has advantages in that they can save time in data entry, improve
          accuracy, can be changed to correct errors, highly visible and provide all the basic bookkeeping needs of a small business.
          Accounting solutions written on spreadsheets are normally limited in relation to financial control and medium sized businesses
          that require additional control over debtors and creditors may be more suited to a database accounting software system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally if a business is large enough to employ a full time bookkeeper or accountant then that business potentially has the
          accounting knowledge and skills within the accounting function to use a database accounting system and achieve the additional
          financial control elements which become available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accounting software that uses a database has the facility to produce regular financial and tax reports, debtors reports and
          statements, creditors reports and statements, cash flow statements and a set of monthly and final accounting reports such as
          profit and loss accounts and balance sheets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disadvantage of such accounting solutions is that to get the most and best out of the system you also need to understand how
          the package works and how technically to obtain from it the benefits of increased financial control that are available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main priority in choosing any accounting package is to first determine the final requirements you need from that
          administrative system. If detailed financial control, particularly over individual supplier or client accounts is essential and
          the business is large enough to employ office based staff including an accountant or full time bookkeeper then a database system
          may be the appropriate choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the business is smaller and requires detailed accounting records to support the year end financial statements while financial
          control is already sufficient to be in the hands of the business owner then accounting software based upon spreadsheets would
          probably be adequate. The degree of adequacy being dependent upon the level of expertise contained and automated within the
          accounts program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Handwritten books would be the lowest choice. Adequate for some small businesses but only suitable if a computer based option was
          impossible.
