        <h2>Personal Qualities Required To Be An Entrepreneur And Start Your Own Business</h2>
        <p>
          The success of every small business and especially a new start up business is dependent upon the personal qualities and abilities
          of the small business owner. Some skills and abilities are more important than others to an entrepreneur but rarely are all
          qualities are required and invariably some are essential to start your own business and make it a success.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lack of skill, ability and experience in certain business areas need not be a barrier to success and starting your own business.
          The personal qualities exerted by a small business owner overcoming deficiencies over and over again are vital and present in many
          entrepreneurs much more so that specific technical knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not everyone is a master of all business attributes in fact very few are. Certainly being a master of all is a fantastic position
          but unrealistic while certain personal qualities are essential to fight the inevitable battles to come. Business battles the
          successful entrepreneur wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Businesses that have grown and become medium sized and bigger are not reliant on the business owner entirely. Employees are
          engaged with specialist skills and abilities to develop and grow the business. A sole trader just starting out has to settle for a
          comfortable living or have the ability to grow the business to the point where more specialist abilities can be added to the
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most small business owners who start a new business do so in an area where that small business owner has some knowledge,
          experience and skill. It is a natural progression having acquired the business knowledge and experience to use those abilities to
          build the business under self employment rules rather than earn profits for an employer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The personal qualities a small business owner possesses are more likely to determine the level of success. Abilities such as hard
          work, determination, persistence, intuition, tolerance and aggression can be the bedrock of success. But the road to success is
          not all slam wham bang for the entrepreneur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small business owners invariably work longer and harder than employees. An employee works for wages and an adequate work
          performance is enough. A small business owner is more likely to be on the job at first light, miss the coffee and dinner break and
          twelve hours later announce he has to finish off for the day because he has to go home and do the business accounting books that
          he started on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determination and persistence go hand in glove with success. Every new business runs into problems at some time or reaches a stage
          where the business owner needs to be completely focused and stick with a strategy to make the plans work. Things go wrong from
          time to time; its normal, determination and persistence are valuable qualities to see through these times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aggression in forcing through a business plan may sometimes be the only viable option. Not physical violence but the heightened
          state of anxiety to push through the plan and make it work with controlled aggression and passion. On the other side of the coin
          there will be times when the small business owner has to exercise tolerance and just go with the flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many small start up businesses go out of business within 2 to 3 years of starting a new business. A major cause is under
          capitalisation which basically means they run out of money. Liquidity is a major area of concern for every small business
          entrepreneur and a cautious approach to a new business can be of considerable value.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a strong tendency for a new business start up to borrow money and buy new equipment just to get started. Such businesses
          are taking a major risk the plans will work. Some plans do work but rarely it is a smooth path and a better option is to build the
          business and reinvest profits made.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more cautious approach would be to start a new business without borrowing substantial funds because if the small business owner
          has the ability to make a success of the business and make money then they can usually do so without external funding and use the
          profits made to build the business in the future. The sound reason for a small business or a start up business to borrow money is
          to already be showing a good financial performance and use extra funds to speed up future success while borrowing funds with no
          track record is a gamble and a gamble which fails only too often.
