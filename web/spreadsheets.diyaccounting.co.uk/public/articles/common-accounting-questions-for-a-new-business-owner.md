Starting you own business brings in a lot of new concepts and terms. Here is a quick run through some of those we regularly encounter from new business owners.

    **What is a Balance Sheet?**
A financial statement that summarizes a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time. These three balance sheet segments give investors an idea as to what the company owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by the shareholders.
    **Assets** - In the context of accounting, assets are either current or fixed (non-current). Current means that the asset will be consumed within one year. Generally, this includes things like cash, accounts receivable and inventory. Fixed assets are those that are expected to keep providing benefit for more than one year, such as equipment, buildings and real estate. 
    **Liabilities** - Recorded on the balance sheet (right side), liabilities include loans, accounts payable, mortgages, deferred revenues and accrued expenses. Liabilities are a vital aspect of a company's operations because they are used to finance operations and pay for large expansions.
    **What are the benefits of forming a limited company over self-employment?**
A limited company can bring tax savings, as you are able to take a dividend instead of simply taking a slice of company income home, as you would have done in self-employment.   And it might even change the way clients look at you .e.g. introducing yourself as director. People may also take the company more seriously.
