          Companies House reject registrations with invalid addresses. It is recommended that all addresses and postcodes are double checked
          before submission on the royal mail site which is a check Companies House will also carry out. Form 10 must be signed and dated by
          each officer and each subscriber to the Memorandum of Association or by an agent on behalf of all the subscribers to the
          Memorandum of Association.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Companies House Form 12</strong> Declaration on application for registration Company formation Form 12 is a statutory
          declaration that all legal requirements relating to the incorporation of the company has been complied with. This declaration can
          be signed by a solicitor engaged in the formation of the Company or a person named as director or secretary on form 10 under
          section 10 of the Companies Act 1985. The Declarant’s signature on form 12 has to be signed in front of and confirmed by a
          Commissioner for Oaths, Notary Public, Justice of the Peace or Solicitor. The date and signing of form 12 must be after all the
          other documents are signed and dated as form 12 is a legal declaration that the details being submitted are true. The form must
          clearly show if a person has signed on behalf of a corporate director. If it appears that the person who signed is not a director,
          this will cause delay.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Memorandum of Association</strong></p>
        <p>
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF279"
            >Every company formation requires a Memorandum of Association which is the record of the limited liability company name, where
            the registered office is situated and the objects of the limited company.<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF279">[6]</a></sup
            ></span
          >
          The memorandum of association objects clause can be as simple as to carry on as a general commercial company. On the first page of
          the Memorandum of Association enter the Company Name. The Memorandum of Association includes the number of shares being issued
          which can be any number the subscribers feel appropriate. On the final page enter the name and addresses of the subscribers to the
          Memorandum. These are the persons who are taking up the first shares in the company. The number of shares issued to each
          subscriber can be set at one share each. This can be changed to whatever arrangement is required provided the total number issued
          is less than the total number of shares. The company's memorandum delivered to the Registrar must be signed by each subscriber in
          front of a witness who must attest the signature. Also enter the name and address of the witness to the subscribers who has signed
          Memorandum of Association. This witness can be any third party able to witness and confirm the signatures are correct.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Articles of Association</strong></p>
        <p>
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF280"
            >The standard Table A, Articles of Association, is a statutory document that governs the internal affairs of the company<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF280">[7]</a></sup
            ></span
          >
          and it is recommended that Table A is adopted in its entirety when starting a company which is limited by shares. If the Articles
          of Association is unmodified then it is not strictly necessary to send this document with the documents for registration. However
          if the Articles of Association are not submitted a letter has to be sent with the application stating that Table A without
          modification is being adopted. It is easier to simply send the unmodified Table A. If Table A is adopted without modification
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF283"
            >at least two directors must be appointed. If the company will have only one director then Table A should be modified<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF283">[8]</a></sup
            ></span
          >
          to reflect this and submitted with the other registration documents. The articles of association delivered to the Registrar must
          be signed by each subscriber of the proposed limited liability company in front of a witness who must attest the signature. If a
          company limited by guarantee is the choice then Articles of Association, Table C and a different Memorandum of association would
          require to be submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Submitting the documents for registration</strong> When Forms 10 and 12 and the Memorandum of Association have been
          completed and checked they should be posted to Companies House with the company registration fee to register the new limited
          liability company. The standard limited liability company registration fee is currently £20, 2008. A limited company registration
          is normally completed within 7 – 10 days when
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF285"
            >the Certificate of Incorporation will be sent to the Company's registered<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF285">[9]</a></sup
            ></span
          >. Same day incorporation is possible at a registration fee of £50. If the express same day service is required the envelope
          should be marked for the attention of “New Companies Section” and “Same Day Incorporation".
