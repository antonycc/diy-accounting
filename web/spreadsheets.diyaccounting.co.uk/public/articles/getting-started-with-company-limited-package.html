        <h2>Getting Started with the Company Limited Package</h2>
        <p>This article will help you get started using the Company Limited Package.</p>
        <p>
          The package is spreadsheet based, so you will need a spreadsheet package to run. If you don’t have Microsoft Excel and don’t plan
          to purchase it, you’ll need an alternative like OpenOffice which you can download free. There is a user guide with the package
          (Companyaccountsuserguide.pdf) which goes into some detail about what to do.
        </p>
        <p>In short:</p>
        <p>Feed last years profit and loss and balance sheet into Financialaccounts.xlsx > OpenAccounts</p>
        <p>Add any outstanding creditors and debtors to Purchases > Opening Creditors and Sales > Opening Debtors</p>
        <p>Add the Opening bank balances to the various cash and bank sheets</p>
        <p>Ensure the balance sheet balances and all the opening balances reconcile with Open Accounts</p>
        <p>
          Then your off, start feeding in sales, purchases and bank transactions and keep reviewing you position using the financial
          accounts file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The files are all linked together so take care not to rename them and if you move the folder around move everything together with
          Excel closed.
        </p>
