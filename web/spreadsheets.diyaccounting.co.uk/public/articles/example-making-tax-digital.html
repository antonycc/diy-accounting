        <h2>Example Making Tax Digital Article</h2>
        <p>This article includes steps by step instructions and an example of an actual Making Tax Digital (MTD) submission.</p>
        <p>
          From April 2019 VAT submissions need to be automated and VitalTax has been designed to work specifically with the layout of the
          DIY Accounting VAT calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do I get the add in?</strong> The add in is available in Excel. On the Insert menu click on get Add Ins. A window
          called office add-ins will appear. Type in VitalTax and click "add". When using the tool, you will need to select “DIY Accounting
          – VAT” in the templates window.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example VAT return submission using DIY Accounting:</strong></p>
        <p>
          /<strong
            >/ div.rbtoc1617331327702 {padding: 0px;} div.rbtoc1617331327702 ul {list-style: disc;margin-left: 0px;} div.rbtoc1617331327702
            li {margin-left: 0px;padding-left: 0px;} /</strong
          >/
        </p>
        <p>
          Once installed (see AccountingForVATWithMakingTaxDigitalArticle) the The Vital Tax add-in Excel is opened on the page of the VAT
          Return being submitted:
        </p>
        <p>Excel's Office Add-ins page shows the installed VitalTax Making Tax Digital Add-in:</p>
        <p>
          To submit your VAT return you must be signed in to Vital Tax and you must authorise VitalTax to submit your VAT Returns to HMRC:
        </p>
        <p>
          After signing in your entity (company, business or VAT registered individual) and VAT number are added your your entity using the
          "Add Entity" button:
        </p>
        <p>Select which returns are due using the menu under "VAT":</p>
        <p>
          If your VitalTax account is not linked to an HMRC account signed up for VAT, the VitalTax Add-in will present a link to sign up:
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the HMRC sign up process is complete your request is acknowledged with an advisory message to suggest how long it will be
          before your sign up is complete:
        </p>
        <p>HMRC will send an email when the sign up is complete:</p>
        <p>Back in DIY Accounting the due VAT returns are displayed:</p>
        <p>You check your profile details using the cog icon:</p>
        <p>To submit the return the VitalTax Excel Add-in provides a template which lines up with DIY Accounting's VAT Returns sheet.</p>
        <p>The VitalTax add-in populates boxes 1 through 7:</p>
        <p>Until VAT Return boxes 8 and 9 are, the VitalTax add-in populates boxes 1 through 7:</p>
        <p>By adding a zero for VAT Return boxes 8 and 9 in Excel cells G34 and G36, the VitalTax add-in populates boxes 8 and 9:</p>
        <p>When the "Submit" button is clicked the VAT Return is submitted:</p>
        <p>Submitted VAT Returns are available for review in the VitalTax add-in:</p>
        <p>
          Once installed (see Accounting For VAT With Making Tax Digital) the The Vital Tax add-in Excel is opened on the page of the VAT
          Return being submitted: Excel's Office Add-ins page shows the installed VitalTax Making Tax Digital Add-in: To submit your VAT
