        </p>
        <p><strong>Affiliate Program Content</strong></p>
        <p>
          Placing a link on your website while essential is not nearly enough. Add real content, quality content either provided by the
          affiliate program website or search the internet, article sites being an exceptional resource. Add high quality content to your
          affiliate program website. In addition to directly relevant content and a link to the affiliate program website add a second link
          direct to that affiliate program website sign up page. Focus the content to encourage visitors to click through to the affiliate
          program. Stimulate visitor interest, pose the question and provide the answer in a link through to the affiliate program website.
          The Affiliate Program website is where you earn your commission and where you want the visitor to go.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Optimise Affiliate Program Content Page</strong></p>
        <p>Use Meta tags to optimise the affiliate program page for search engines:</p>
        <p><title>Content Specific maximum 80 characters, preferably 70</title></p>
        <p><meta name="description" content="Use your keywords to write description and keep below 250 characters, preferably 150" /></p>
        <p><meta name="Keywords" content="Choose 5 - 10 keywords that will get your site on the first 10 organic search pages" /></p>
        <p><meta name="Robots" content="All" /></p>
        <p>Meta tags can be checked and improved at www.submitexpress.co.uk for free</p>
        <p>
          Choosing the highest volume search terms is tremendously beneficial if your affiliate program content page has a high page rank.
          Be realistic, if your affiliate program page has a lower page rank choose less popular keywords to increase your chance of being
          searched. Use a free optimisation site to ensure title; description; keywords and relevancy score 100%. After optimisation submit
          the affiliate program webpage with the two tier affiliate program links using a free submission service to get the affiliate
          program page indexed and listed.
        </p>
        <p>If your website as a site map add the affiliate program page to that map for indexing</p>
        <p><strong>Link Popularity Drives Traffic</strong></p>
        <p>
          List the affiliate program content page on suitable directories, hundreds of links back to this page will drive traffic and
          improve the page rank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Write articles relevant to the affiliate program content and post these through the internet. Consider an article submitter to
          automate part of this process, avoid spamming the article sites. Writing good quality articles will increase link popularity and
          drive even more traffic to your content page. Get articles from the Two Tier Affiliate Program website.
        </p>
        <p>Approach and write articles for ezines and newsletters relative to content or your two tier affiliate program.</p>
        <p>
          Conduct searches using main industry keywords to find similar content websites and invite non competitive sites to join your two
          tier affiliate program.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Set and Achieve Targets</strong></p>
        <p>
          Set targets for sales and affiliate recruitment, work at page content and popularity links to drive traffic to achieve the
          targets. It helps if your affiliate marketing program is a free affiliate program. A free affiliate program is one less barrier to
          joining your affiliate program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be persistent and determined. Achieve the goals of your very own affiliate marketing program. The cash will follow. Remember Lady
          Luck? Lady Luck is proportionate to the number of chances you make for yourself. Give yourself enough chances and Lady Luck will
          smile in your direction. <strong><em>Good Luck!</em></strong>
