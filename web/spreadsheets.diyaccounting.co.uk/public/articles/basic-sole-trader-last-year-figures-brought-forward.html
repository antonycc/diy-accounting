        <h2>Basic Sole Trader Last Year Figures Brought Forward</h2>
        <p>This article explains how you record last year's figures in this current year's Basic Sole Trader package</p>
        <p>
          To record last year's figures in this year's package, do the following: Your Losses carried from last year's Business Details >
          O34 would be copied to this year's Business Details > D29 In Fixed Assets, the date purchased, description and original cost would
          be copied over. Where entries has been in the New Fixed Assets section last ear they would be in the Existing Fixed Assets section
          this year. Once the basic data is in there the closing Written Down Tax Value from last year (values in column M) is copied to the
          opening Written Down Tax Value (column I). For most small businesses you'll have used the full Annual Investment Allowance to
          claim the full value of everything except vehicles in the year of purchase against tax. This means your opening Written Down Tax
          Value is likely to be zero for most assets.
