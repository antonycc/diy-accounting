        <h2>Accounts Audit</h2>
        <p>This article helps you audit your accounts to help find any errors.</p>
        <p>
          If your accounts do not balance or you believe something isn't correct - you can follow the following steps to audit your own
          accounts. The Closing Creditors (in purchases) and Closing Debtors (in sales) is a good place to start when looking for an error.
          Go back to the earliest set of accounts you have just before the error was observed and ensure you have entered a list of closing
          creditors and debtors that matches the closing creditors and debtors balances and that the line items are what you'd expect.
          (Note, the creditors balance also includes dividend creditors). If you haven't found the source of the error, the next thing to do
          would be to go through each sale and purchase ensuring it reconciles against the cash and bank account sheets. Columns J though M
          in Sales and Purchases are useful when auditing, you can expand Column J and enter more detail such as the date the setting
          transaction occurred. The next thing would be to go back the other way starting with the bank account sheets. When you are done,
          you should be able to pick any entry in sales or purchases and identify when it was settled and pick any transaction in the bank
          sheets and identify what it was for. The above takes time when done retrospectively. In the future you can avoid this by
          completing the bank account sheets in advance, so when you get the statement you should be comparing identical documents rather
          than doing a bit of forensic accounting. You can also look at the fixed assets sheet that has a "FA reconciliation" sheet that
          checks transactions in fixed assets against sales and purchases.
