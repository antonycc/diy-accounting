        <h2>Software Can Be Sophisticated Or Simple Bookkeeping But Rarely Both</h2>
        <p>
          Many types of accounting software exist to record the financial transactions of business and provide the management with financial
          control to achieve the profit and loss performance required. The correct choice is highly dependent upon the size of the business
          and the degree of sophistication and financial control required.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.diyaccounting.co.uk">Accounting software</a> is a system of recording financial transactions on a computer
          across a full range of accounting options almost invariably dependent upon the size of business being catered for. Accounting
          software can vary from multi million pound solutions for major public companies to simple managed lists of income and expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The requirements from accounting software are diverse with the most complex and comprehensive financial accounting packages
          incorporating financial reporting information and managed by teams of qualified accountants supported by accounts clerks,
          bookkeepers and substantial input from automated data sources. At the other end of the scale a self employed sole trader might use
          accounting software themselves and produce a set of financial accounts for the year in an afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different accounting standards are required from accounting software dependent upon the fitness for purpose and client needs.
          Double entry bookkeeping automated through a database system and probably arranged in financial modules would normally be the
          choice of the majority of public companies. Single entry bookkeeping would not be an acceptable accounting solution for a limited
          company due to audit requirements and statutory obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Single entry bookkeeping does however have its place in the market place for the smaller less complex businesses who maintain
          financial control through a close intimate knowledge of every financial transaction. The main objective of a sole trader is more
          likely to be the production of the tax accounts and complete the periodic and annual tax return forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most sophisticated level of accounting software in the largest companies mirrors the accounting functions in those
          organisations with various financial modules for accounts receivable, accounts payable, stock control, general ledger and fixed
          assets. These accounting modules may also be integrated with non accounting functions such as production and dispatch functions
          and also divided into separate modules within the accounting function.
        </p>
        <p>
          In larger companies the sales daybook and data entry of sales turnover would often be the responsibility of one department while
          the accounts receivable function might be split with a specialist credit control function within that accounting module. A further
          division may also include sales administration and customer records. Similarly the accounts payable function might be split
          between the purchasing department, accounts purchase invoice department and a legal function for overdue payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Company accounting software for smaller companies and organisations is commonly a system of data entry of prime transactions which
          include sales income, purchase expenses and cash and bank transactions. The prime entry of these documents being to a database
          which automates the double entry accounting principles and produces both accounts receivable, accounts payable and general ledger
          databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some accounting knowledge is usually required tom operate a database accounting software system and that financial knowledge is
          usually available within the company as most companies that use database accounting software also employ a bookkeeper or accounts
          clerks to input data and in slightly larger small companies also qualified accountants to manage the accounting function.
        </p>
        <p>
          The need for accounting knowledge in a database system is partially to understand the data entry principles and the relevancy of
          the rules that need to be followed but essentially understanding of accounting principles is required to understand what is
          happening ton the information after input. And most important, a qualified accountant has the financial knowledge, training and
          experience to know what the system should be producing and how to query the database to retrieve that information.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to inputting the prime income and expenditure details the most benefit of a database accounting system is the level of
          financial control the information it contains can provide the company management and financial directorship. The accounting
          function also has the security of producing trial balances, periodic profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and other financial
          and statements for tax and control purposes.
        </p>
        <p>Bookkeeping software packages requiring little or no accounting knowledge are available.</p>
        <p>
          Small limited companies must obtain accounting software based upon double entry accounting principles as in addition to producing
          a profit and loss account and a trial balance to demonstrate accuracy and integrity of the financial records plus a balance sheet
          is required for reporting purposes. Accounting standards require the limited company to have a system of financial control and
          accounting software is an essential tool in achieving this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some accounting knowledge either from the management or outsourcing the bookkeeping services is usually required with even the
          simplest database accounting solutions even if this requires the understanding of what accounts receivable ledgers, accounts
          payable ledger and control accounts mean.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other possibilities and those businesses with a minimum of accounting knowledge can consider spreadsheet based
          accounting software. Accounting software compiled from spreadsheets is less flexible and often does not have the range of options
          a database system has due to the lack of database queries available. These disadvantages of flexibility being compensated by the
          fact that all entries are visible, transparent and changes can be made more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Financially at the sole trader and self employed end of the business spectrum then the requirements from accounting software may
          be completely different. Gone are the sophistications of control accounts, trial balances and many aspects of financial control.
          The most important aspect of self employed accounting software is often to produce a set of accounts for tax purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self employed small business that do not require a balance sheet can use accounting spreadsheets based upon single entry
          bookkeeping rather than double entry and with the reduced requirement for financial control then less financial queries to the
          system are required. In these respects the simpler an accounting solution the better and in this market an accounting solution
          written on bookkeeping spreadsheets that can produce the net taxable profit would meet the requirements.
