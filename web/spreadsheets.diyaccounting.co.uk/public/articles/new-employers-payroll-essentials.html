        <h2>Payroll Essentials for New Employers</h2>
        <p>
          An employee is anyone who works on a full time, part time or casual basis for the business and includes company directors. When
          you engage someone to work for you, you become their employer.
          <span data-ref="REF104">Every employer operating a PAYE scheme must have an understanding of the HMRC payroll essentials.</span>
          Payroll essentials that payroll software packages satisfy include both the knowledge to correctly calculate income tax and
          national insurance plus legal obligations to each employee.
        </p>
        <p><strong>When should an Employer Register for PAYE</strong></p>
        <p>
          <span data-ref="REF241">Employers should register as soon as possible when a qualifying employee is appointed</span> and
          <span data-ref="REF149">may register up to four weeks prior to the first employees pay day</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should register as an employer and operate a PAYE system if your employee already has other employment, or if
          <span data-ref="REF150">the employee's earnings are equal to or above the PAYE threshold</span>. The PAYE threshold for 2007-08 is
          earnings of £100 per week or £435 per month at which point income tax and national insurance deductions may be required. These
          limits include the value of any benefits in kind that may be paid.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Employer Registration Information Required</strong></p>
        <p>
          Generally the information to be provided includes the business name, trading address, type of business, name and address of the
          employer, national insurance number and tax office reference of the employer, contact telephone number and email address if
          applying by email.,
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition details will be required of the likely number of employees, frequency of payment, the date the first employee was
          appointed and the first payment date. Also have available the address where the payroll records will be kept and the contact
          details of the person responsible for the payroll.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where partners are involved details of each partner’s names, addresses, national insurance numbers and tax office references will
          be required and the LLP. number for Limited Liability Partnerships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limited Companies will be required to supply the address of the company’s registered office, date of incorporation and company
          registration number plus details of the directors; names, addresses, contact telephone numbers, national insurance numbers, tax
          office references
        </p>
        <p><strong>How to register as a PAYE Employer</strong></p>
        <p>
          Employers can register for PAYE online at the HMRC website. Click Employers - Register as an Employer - First steps as an Employer
          - scroll down the page until you can click email which then presents you with online registration form to complete and send.
          Alternatively contact HMRC Employer Helpline at 0845 6070 143.
        </p>
        <p><strong>PAYE and Payroll Records</strong></p>
        <p>
          Accurate payroll records are essential, full stop.
          <span data-ref="REF239">Employers must keep payroll records for both HMRC purposes and employees.</span> The employee records must
          include the name and address of the employee, national insurance number, date of birth, income tax code, all payments and benefits
          made and all deductions for income tax, national insurance and voluntary deductions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When registering to operate a PAYE system immediate arrangements should be made to ensure these records are maintained either by
          setting up the records yourself using the help and advice contained in the Revenue CD-ROM provided to all new and existing
          employers or employing a payroll service to produce the records or using a payroll software package.
        </p>
        <p>
          Various payroll software packages are available with different degrees of complexity. The DIY Accounting Payroll Software is an
          ideal solution for small employers being written on excel spreadsheets and in addition to producing the deduction calculations and
          payslips the payroll software also automatically completes an excel copy of the compulsory HMRC forms significantly easing the
          administrative burden.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Paying Employees</strong></p>
        <p>
          <span data-ref="REF240">Employees must be paid the national minimum wage</span> which for adults was raised on the 1st October

          <span data-ref="REF157"
            >Every employee must receive a payslip that shows the amount of income tax and national insurance deducted from the gross
            pay.</span
          >
          In addition <span data-ref="REF105">every employer must also calculate the employer's national insurance contribution</span>. If
          you are an employer and not operating a payroll software system such as the DIY Accounting Payroll Software then you must design a
          payslip to give to your employees to satisfy legal requirements.
        </p>
