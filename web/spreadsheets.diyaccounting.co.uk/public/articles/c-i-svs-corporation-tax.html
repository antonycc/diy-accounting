        <h2>CIS vs Corporation Tax</h2>
        <p>
          This article explains how to record
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF129"
            >CIS deductions<sup><a href="../references.html#REF129">[2]</a></sup></span
          >
          and income received.
        </p>
        <p>To record Income received as a Sub Contractor, you would input the following:</p>
        <p>
          Example - Income of £1000 gross and
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF289"
            >20% CIS was deducted by the contractor<sup><a href="../references.html#REF289">[1]</a></sup></span
          >
          (£200.00) so the net amount received was £800, In Sales, enter the amount of gross income (£1000) and the CIS deducted (£200) in
          the CIS column on the same row. In current account enter the amount actually received from the debtor (main contractor) £800.00
        </p>
        <p>In the cash account payments section make 2 entries:</p>
        <p>&bull; A payment to CIS of -£200 (minus 200) using code RC</p>
        <p>
          &bull; A payment of Corporation Tax of £200 using code RT This "journal entry" is cash neutral and just moves the liability from
          one account to the other. Your corporation tax calculation remains the same, but the liability in the balance sheet reduces.
        </p>
