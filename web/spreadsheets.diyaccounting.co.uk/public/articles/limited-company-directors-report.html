          and believe the established systems including the computerization of the company's financial accounts are appropriate to the
          business. No material losses or contingencies have arisen during the 12 months trading period that would require disclosure by the
          directors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having formed an opinion at the time of approving these accounts it is the intention of the directors to continue to support the
          company financially, the profits earned and retained within the company being sufficient to ensure the company has adequate
          resources to continue existing trading policies and the directors have adopted a going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the view of the directors that the company accounts presented represent a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
          company and result for the 12 months to year end accounts date. Suitable accounting policies have been established and applied
          consistently and disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the company.
