This article explains how to use the Cash Accounting Scheme rather than the Double Entry Scheme.

To use DIY Accounting package with a Cash Accounting scheme rather than the normal Double Entry scheme, only enter the values in Sales and Purchases when the transaction actually clears and use the cleared transaction date. 
    For a Cash Accounting scheme the information in Sales and Purchase would match the transactions in Cash...xls and Bank...xsl.
(The easiest way I find to do this is to enter Sales and Purchases when reconciling against a monthly bank statement.)
