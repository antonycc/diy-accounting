        <h2>Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment (ITSA)</h2>

        <p>
          Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment (MTD for ITSA) is the next phase of HMRC's digitalisation programme. Following
          the rollout of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-making-tax-digital-for-vat">MTD for VAT</a>, HMRC is extending the Making
          Tax Digital requirements to self-employed individuals and landlords who file Self Assessment tax returns. This article explains
          who will be affected, when the requirements begin, and how to prepare.
        </p>

        <h3>When Does MTD for ITSA Start?</h3>
        <p>
          According to
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax"
            >HMRC's guidance on MTD for Income Tax</a
          >, the programme is being introduced in phases based on income levels:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>From April 2026:</strong>
            <span class="ref" data-ref="REF016"
              >Self-employed individuals and landlords with annual gross income over &pound;50,000 from self-employment and/or property must
              comply with MTD for ITSA<sup><a href="../references.html#REF016">[1]</a></sup></span
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>From April 2027:</strong>
            <span class="ref" data-ref="REF034"
              >The threshold drops to include those with annual gross income over &pound;30,000<sup
                ><a href="../references.html#REF034">[2]</a></sup
              ></span
            >.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          HMRC has indicated that the threshold may be lowered further in future years, but no dates have been confirmed for those with
          income below &pound;30,000.
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF035"
            >General partnerships were originally planned to be included but have been deferred, and no date has been set for their
            inclusion<sup><a href="../references.html#REF035">[3]</a></sup></span
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>Who Will Need to Comply?</h3>
        <p>
          MTD for ITSA will apply to individuals who meet all of the following criteria, as described in
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax">HMRC's detailed guidance</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>They are registered for Self Assessment.</li>
          <li>They have income from self-employment and/or UK property (including furnished holiday lettings).</li>
          <li>
            Their qualifying income exceeds the relevant threshold (<span class="ref" data-ref="REF016"
              >&pound;50,000 from April 2026<sup><a href="../references.html#REF016">[1]</a></sup></span
            >,
            <span class="ref" data-ref="REF034"
              >&pound;30,000 from April 2027<sup><a href="../references.html#REF034">[2]</a></sup></span
            >).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF038"
            >Income from employment, pensions, savings, dividends, or foreign property does not count towards the MTD for ITSA threshold<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF038">[4]</a></sup
            ></span
          >. Only income from self-employment and UK property rental is relevant.
        </p>

        <h3>What Changes Under MTD for ITSA?</h3>
        <p>The key changes compared to the current Self Assessment system are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Digital record-keeping.</strong>
            <span class="ref" data-ref="REF039"
              >You must use
              <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-software-thats-compatible-with-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax"
                >MTD-compatible software</a
              >
              to keep digital records of your business income and expenses<sup><a href="../references.html#REF039">[5]</a></sup></span
            >. Spreadsheets may be used with bridging software, similar to how MTD for VAT works.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quarterly updates.</strong> Instead of submitting one annual tax return, you will need to send quarterly updates to HMRC
            summarising your income and expenses.
            <span class="ref" data-ref="REF036"
              >These updates are due by the 7th of the month following the end of each quarter<sup
                ><a href="../references.html#REF036">[6]</a></sup
              ></span
            >:
            <ul>
              <li>Quarter 1 (6 April to 5 July): update due by 7 August</li>
              <li>Quarter 2 (6 July to 5 October): update due by 7 November</li>
              <li>Quarter 3 (6 October to 5 January): update due by 7 February</li>
              <li>Quarter 4 (6 January to 5 April): update due by 7 May</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>End of Period Statement (EOPS).</strong> After the end of the tax year, you submit a finalisation statement confirming
            that the quarterly updates are complete and accurate. This replaces the self-employment section of the current Self Assessment
            tax return.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Final declaration.</strong> You still need to make a final declaration (equivalent to the current Self Assessment tax
            return) that brings together all your income sources and calculates your tax liability.
            <span class="ref" data-ref="REF037"
              >This is due by 31 January following the tax year<sup><a href="../references.html#REF037">[7]</a></sup></span
            >, the same deadline as the current Self Assessment return.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Prepare</h3>
        <p>Even though MTD for ITSA may not apply to you until April 2026 or later, there are steps you can take now to be ready:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Start keeping digital records.</strong> If you are already using a DIY Accounting spreadsheet to record your income and
            expenses, you are well on your way. The spreadsheets provide a structured digital record of your business transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Get familiar with quarterly reporting.</strong> Consider reviewing your income and expenses quarterly, even if you are
            not yet required to submit quarterly updates. This will help you identify any gaps in your record-keeping and make the
            transition smoother.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check if you are affected.</strong> Review your gross income from self-employment and property to determine whether you
            will exceed the
            <span class="ref" data-ref="REF016"
              >&pound;50,000 threshold from April 2026<sup><a href="../references.html#REF016">[1]</a></sup></span
            >
            or the
            <span class="ref" data-ref="REF034"
              >&pound;30,000 threshold from April 2027<sup><a href="../references.html#REF034">[2]</a></sup></span
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Watch for software updates.</strong> DIY Accounting will provide compatible software and guidance as the MTD for ITSA
            requirements are finalised. Keep an eye on <a href="https://diyaccounting.co.uk">diyaccounting.co.uk</a> for updates.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How DIY Accounting Spreadsheets Can Help</h3>
        <p>
          DIY Accounting's <a href="../download.html">spreadsheet packages</a> for sole traders and self-employed businesses are designed to
          record income and expenses in a structured format that aligns with HMRC's requirements. The spreadsheets already calculate the
          figures needed for your Self Assessment tax return, and the same data can be used for the quarterly updates required under MTD for
          ITSA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as DIY Accounting provides a free MTD VAT submission service at
          <a href="https://submit.diyaccounting.co.uk">submit.diyaccounting.co.uk</a>, the intention is to support MTD for ITSA submissions
          as the programme goes live.
        </p>
