This article helps if you do need to amend the set data on the spreadsheets.

Adding or deleting rows and columns from the sheets is likely to break the formula.
What you can do is add additional sheets to the same files to do any extract calculations that you need, then copy the values into where they are used.
Some sheets are locked to avoid accidental change but there is no password on most so you can unlock to change row and column labels.
Once you get into changing the structure or formulae your proceeding at your own risk.
If you do this have all the files open so Excel can propagate any changes and take a backup before you start.
