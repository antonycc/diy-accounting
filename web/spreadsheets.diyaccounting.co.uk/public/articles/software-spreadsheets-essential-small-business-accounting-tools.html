        <h2>Software Spreadsheets Are Essential Small Business Accounting Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Accurate financial records must be kept by every business and bookkeeping software spreadsheets can satisfy this requirement.
          Further by adopting a simple accounting system the small business can use the bookkeeping spreadsheets to both manage financial
          control over the business and complete the essential task of reporting for tax purposes
        </p>
        <p>
          Businesses generally make extensive use of spreadsheets both in accounting and all other business fields. Being a numerically
          based system of analysing information spreadsheets are used throughout every accounting function as the technique presents an
          ideal basis to maintain accuracy and automate the collection of financial information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every small business needs to keep records of sales invoices and income received and purchase invoices in respect of expenses. It
          is not sufficient for accounting and taxation purposes for these receipts and payments to be left in the office or the back of a
          van in a carrier bag. At some stage these prime bookkeeping documents need to be processed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Processing the financial documents related to a business enterprise basically means they need to be listed. For taxation and
          financial control purposes the invoices also need to be added up and analysed. The most basic method would be to simply make a
          list of the sales income and a second list of the purchase expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a manual method of listing the information falls short of the analysis required and is more time consuming that using a
          little technology to both ensure the summation is accurate and the analysis simplified. Listing the sales and expenses of a small
          business on spreadsheets is no more difficult then a manual paper system and has tremendous advantages in automating and ensuring
          accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>Hence the use of bookkeeping spreadsheets to prepare the accounting information required.</p>
        <p>
          Instead of listing the items on a paper list the items can be just as easily listed on a spreadsheet which will add up the items
          as required without the requirement to double check the adding up is accurate. Such a list has a history in accounting term as a
          sales daybook and a purchase daybook
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve the required analysis of sales and purchases all that is required is to write into the top of each of the spreadsheet
          columns the titles of the analysis headings required. Then repeat the value of each transaction in the total column into the
          analysis columns. Use the spreadsheet technology to add up each column and you have an effective bookkeeping spreadsheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preparing such a bookkeeping spreadsheet might and often does suffice the needs of the smallest business enterprise and is a close
          step towards achieving a valuable tool for this purpose, bookkeeping software. Bookkeeping software can be as simple as a home
          produced spreadsheet but with additional facets that can have significant financial benefits to the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bookkeeping software produced on spreadsheets would normally be a series of spreadsheets with the columns preset and titled and
          formulae written into the sheet to automatically add up each column. In addition the columns used would normally be restricted to
          general headings to include a full analysis of all items.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small businesses that might produce their own spreadsheet would often do this on an annual basis. Bookkeeping software is much
          more likely to provide these bookkeeping spreadsheet templates on a monthly basis to enable a degree of financial control to be
          exercised by the small business.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the second real value of bookkeeping spreadsheets, the ability to provide the business with financial information and
          through that data financial control over the business activities. The first value is of course the simplicity of listing with
          automated summation of the figures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small businesses can also benefit from professionally produced bookkeeping spreadsheet that has been specifically arranged not
          just to produce a list of income and expenses but also in a way that analyses that information in the way the small business
          requires it. There are two main requirements of the way the financial records are analysed being to produce a financial profit and
          loss account for the business on a periodic basis but also to provide the totals of the categories required for taxation purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buying a piece of bookkeeping software written on an accounting spreadsheet can thus become an essential tool for the business.
          The essential element being to both make the accounting simple and easy as listing items, automated analysis and summation
          assisting the financial control and improved financial performance while also producing the benefits of being analysed to make the
          completion of annual tax return forms easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone in business wants to make a profit making financial control important. Everyone in business has to fill in tax forms and
          submit accounts in the tax authority format. Bookkeeping spreadsheets provide an essential accounting tool for every business to
          achieve these objectives.
