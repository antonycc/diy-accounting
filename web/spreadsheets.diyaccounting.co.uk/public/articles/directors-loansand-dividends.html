            >Any money taken out of the company which is not a salary or dividend, over and above the amount you have put in by a company
            director or "participator", is called a Directors Loan and is repayable to the company.<sup

          Alternatively, a director can loan money to the Company.
        </p>
        <p>
          An existing Directors Loan from the previous year would be entered in DIY Accounting's Limited Company Financial Accounts Software
          in Financialaccounts.xls > OpenAccounts > Cell E30. If the company owes you money the loan amount would be positive. When you want
          the company to pay the Director back, you make an entry in the payments section of currentaccount.xls using code DL. The Balance
          Sheet (Financialaccount.xls > PubBalSht) shows you the current Directors Loan amount and the balance at the start of the year. The
          Directors Loan can be overdrawn too (meaning the director owes the company). To pay the company back after going overdrawn this
          would be a receipt entered into currentaccount.xls also using code DL but in the receipts section.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF211"
            >There are tax implications for having an outstanding loan from the company<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF211">[3]</a></sup
            ></span
          >, so it's best not to abuse this.
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF212"
            >When the directors loan account becomes overdrawn (the company has loaned money to a director) personal tax will then be liable
            on the benefit of the tax free loan.<sup><a href="../references.html#REF212">[4]</a></sup></span
          >
          HMRC may also consider a regular pattern of taking loans as if they are wages. When you want to draw down on profits you can take
          a dividend. It's best to do this at the end of the year when you know your profit after tax. Some companies take mid year
          dividends where they can forecast profits. In a similar way to loans, regular payments that look a lot like wages can be
          considered wages. The dividend amount is decided at the company annual meeting and the amount entered in the Companysecretary.xls
          > Boardmeeting to record the decision and the payment transactions are recorded in Currentaccount.xls using code DV.
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF056"
            >The dividend is paid out of profits which have already paid or due to pay tax on.<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF056">[5]</a></sup
            ></span
          >
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF141"
            >Tax credits are therefore available for the shareholder to offset any income tax from their dividend against.<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF141">[6]</a></sup
            ></span
          >
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF213"
            >If you need to submit a Self Assessment Tax Return, you will need to declare dividends when doing so.<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF213">[7]</a></sup
            ></span

          If you do not but use a higher tax rate, contact HMRC.
