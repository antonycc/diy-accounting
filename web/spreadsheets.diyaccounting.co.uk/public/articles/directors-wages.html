        <p>How do I Input Directors Wages into my Accounts?</p>
        <p>
          As a Director and 100% Shareholder you can take drawings out of the business, either as
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF054"
            >Dividends (which attract capital gains tax)<sup><a href="../references.html#REF054">[1]</a></sup></span
          >
          or as a
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF055"
            >Salary (which is PAYE)<sup><a href="../references.html#REF055">[2]</a></sup></span
          >.
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF056"
            >The dividends are a drawing on profits (or reserves) by shareholders.<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF056">[3]</a></sup
            ></span
          >
          This is separate from the director's remuneration. An entry is made in the company secretary file for the dividend amount agreed
          for the year and the actual payment (or payments) are recorded in currentaccounts.xls. Your tax liability will be a personal tax
          liability you pay when sending your accounts in to HMRC. If you pay yourself a Salary and are a Director of the business these
          costs are part of the administration cost for the company and appear as "director's remuneration" in the Profit and Loss. You can
          use HMRC's Payroll to enter the monthly Salary into the system and then direct into the package using the Wages Interface sheet.

            <strong>Editor's note (2025/26):</strong> The original article states that dividends "attract capital gains tax". This is
            incorrect: dividends are subject to <strong>Income Tax</strong> at the dividend tax rates (8.75% basic, 33.75% higher, 39.35%
            additional), not capital gains tax. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends">GOV.UK: Tax on dividends</a> for current
            rates.
