        <h2>Choosing A Small Business Payroll Software Package</h2>
        <p>
          Running a successful small business presupposes the proprietor is Jack of all Trades when in reality the truth is they are Master
          of One. Payroll is but one part of business management where expertise is required. Mastering the paye administration system is an
          essential function carrying with it substantial adherence to legislation and the needs and motivation of its employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running a payroll for larger organisations with full time accounting staff is easy. Full time professionals are employed or the
          payroll function may be outsourced to a payroll bureau. For the small business the payroll task often falls to the proprietor
          demanding even more time to familiarise with current payroll legislation and a not insignificant amount of administration time
          that could be better spent making profits than number crunching. For small business organisations with five to ten employees
          calculating the income tax and national insurance contributions in producing the weekly payroll can easily take an hour or more
          each week. An hour that could be better spent earning profits or at the very least having an extra hour of free time each week.
          Free time that small business owner’s value at a premium since the majority of small business owners either work or think about
          work from dawn to dusk 7 days a week. A small business payroll software package to satisfy the PAYE requirements can be just one
          part of making that small business more efficient. Small businesses that fail to operate a sound payroll system can produce a
          negative effect on the employees. The pay an employee receives is expected, often spent or spoken for on receipt and provided the
          amount is a competitive rate would only rarely have an effect on staff relations. However operating a payroll system that does not
          provide each employee with a payslip is like telling your employee he has received a personal letter that was opened for him and
          discarded as not important. To the employee a payslip is very important. And so important in that every employer has a legal
          responsibility to provide each employee with a payslip and at the end of each year a P60 End of Year Employees Certificate. A
          Payroll Software package will satisfy both the legal requirement and the employee’s requirements. Failure to provide employees
          with payslips can only reduce the respect hat employee has for his employer. Every employee must receive a payslip that shows the
          amount of income tax and national insurance deducted from the gross pay. Every employer must also calculate the employer’s
          national insurance contribution. Employers not using a payroll software package such as available from DIY Accounting Payroll
          Software must design their own payslip to give to employees to satisfy legal requirements. In the UK producing a weekly or monthly
          payroll can be a burdensome task to comply with the HMRC requirements. HMRC provide much expertise advice in this area both via
          their website and each year through the distribution of the Employers CD-Rom. To fully appreciate all the technicalities and
          complete all the correct documents such as the P11 Deductions Working sheet is time consuming. It doesn’t have to be a problem.
          Payroll Software can automate this knowledge and functions and is available at insignificant cost. The DIY Accounting Payroll
          Software package is available for five to twenty employees at a cost of £15 to £25. That is a payroll software package that could
          save a small business over an hour a week, for twenty employees more like two hours, for less than 50p per week. All small
          business owners should at least consider suitable efficient payroll software. Many small business payroll software packages are
          written using databases and can put small business owners off using them due to both the cost and the fear of the unknown
          complexity of using such a payroll package. Payroll software packages written on a database provide an excellent solution but have
          a tendency to be extremely politically correct and cover all potential rules and regulations and consequently become more complex
          to operate as they can demand at least a minimum knowledge of the payroll system. There are other PAYE solutions. The DIY
          Accounting Payroll Software is written on excel accounting spreadsheets requiring no payroll experience and a minimum of entries
          to produce all the essential calculations of income tax and employees and employers national insurance. In addition excel copies
          of the time consuming P11 Deductions working sheet, P60 Employees Certificate and the P35 Annual Employers Return are all
          automated to save the small business valuable administration time. A significant advantage of a payroll software system written on
          payroll accounting spreadsheets is that it can also be used with excel and an open office spreadsheet package with all entries
          visible offering transparency. Errors and mistakes can be easily corrected simply by changing the numbers on the payroll ensuring
          the payroll is produced both quickly and accurately. Payroll Software is an effective tool that should receive serious
          consideration by all small business proprietors. Payroll Software also has the advantage because it can be simple and fast to use
          of avoiding late payments to the revenue and the consequent unwanted letters and potential fines this can invoke. By having all
          the information required for the monthly or quarterly revenue payments late penalties can be avoided and by producing the Annual
          Employers return on time small business owners can submit their returns online and receive a tax free online filing bonus. The
          current online foiling bonus being £150 and substantially more than the payroll software might have cost. And it’s Tax Free.
