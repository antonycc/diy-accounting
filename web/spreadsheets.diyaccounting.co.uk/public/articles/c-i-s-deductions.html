        <h2>CIS Deductions</h2>
        <p>This article explains how to input the transactions for CIS deductions.</p>
        <p>Being the main-contractor</p>
        <p>
          ========================= Enter the gross in purchases using column D (other direct costs) in the Basic Sole Trader package. Some
          other packages have a specific category for sub-contractors. Then enter the
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF129"
            >CIS deducted<sup><a href="../references.html#REF129">[1]</a></sup></span
          >
          in column Y. When you come to do your
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF130"
            >monthly CIS return<sup><a href="../references.html#REF130">[2]</a></sup></span
          >
          you can use the total at the top of column Y. Once HMRC have been paid, the payments actually made balance what's in the gross.
          (<span class="ref" data-ref="REF129"
            >Net to sub-contractor + Tax to HMRC = Gross<sup><a href="../references.html#REF129">[1]</a></sup></span
          >)
        </p>
        <p>Being a sub-contractor</p>
        <p>
          ====================== DIY Accounting has a area for you to keep track of CIS payments. You do the calculation yourself based on
          the contractors status / use of materials etc.. and populate the far column (AK) in the Purchases sheet. DIY Accounting keeps
          track of the total amount owed to HMRC for the contractors as this is a liability. You'll need to make a note of the deduction for
          each sub-contractor when issuing a remittance slip to pay their invoices. Some CIS tips...
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF131"
            >Where the tax has been deducted at source and paid to HMRC on your behalf<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF131">[3]</a></sup
            ></span
          >
          the gross amount amount charged (before CIS is taken off) is entered in column G then the amount of CIS tax applied is entered in
          column W.
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF131"
            >The amount of tax paid on your behalf is taken off your tax bill as tax already paid<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF131">[3]</a></sup
            ></span
          >, you can see this in the Income Tax sheet in financialaccounts050411.xls.
        </p>
        <p>When you complete the Sale:</p>
        <p>Sales Column F: A, B or C</p>
        <p>Sales Column G: Gross figure before CIS deduction</p>
        <p>Sales Column W: Amount of CIS tax deducted</p>
        <p>When paid: (optional)</p>
        <p>Sales Column L: Amount received</p>
        <p>Sales Column M: Overwrite with zero when you been paid (it doesn't copy with the deduction)</p>
