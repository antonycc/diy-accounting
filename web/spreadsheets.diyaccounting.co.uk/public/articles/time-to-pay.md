This article explains what to do if you cannot pay your tax bill on time.

**If you cannot pay because of coronavirus (COVID-19)**
    Because of coronavirus you may be able to delay (defer) [your Self Assessment payment on account](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defer-your-self-assessment-payment-on-account-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19) due in July 2020 until 31 January 2021.
    [Contact the HMRC coronavirus (COVID-19) helpline](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/coronavirus-covid-19-helpline) if you cannot pay any other tax bills because of coronavirus.
    **If you’re self-employed**
    If your business has been affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), you may be able to claim a grant through the [Self-Employment Income Support Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme).
    **If you cannot pay your Self Assessment tax bill for other reasons**
    If you owe £30,000 or less then you might be able to [set up a Time to Pay Arrangement online](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/pay-what-you-owe-in-instalments/arrangement/determine-eligibility?_ga=2.110561413.1484119173.1602596269-1925466909.1588262911).

    **If you cannot pay other taxes**
    You might be able to set up a Time to Pay Arrangement with HMRC if you’re unable to pay any other taxes in full. This lets you pay what you owe in instalments.
How you do this depends on whether you’ve received a payment demand.
If you’ve received a payment demand, like a tax bill or a letter threatening you with legal action, call the HMRC office that sent you the letter.
If you’ve not received a bill or letter, call the Payment Support Service.
