Sample directors report required when the company director submits the company year end accounts to HMRC requiring a limited company directors report
    The company accounts year end reports to HMRC and Companies House are different for small private limited companies. Companies House accept abbreviated year end accounts including a profit statement and balance sheet with notes and statutory statements.
    HMRC receive the same year end documents plus the corporation tax calculation, CT600 corporation tax return. Also since HMRC require more detailed information to verify the net taxable profit they require more detailed expenditure analysis in the company profit statement and also expect a limited company directors report with the year end accounts.
