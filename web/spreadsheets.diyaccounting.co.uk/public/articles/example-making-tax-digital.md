This article includes steps by step instructions and an example of an actual Making Tax Digital (MTD) submission.

From April 2019 VAT submissions need to be automated and VitalTax has been designed to work specifically with the layout of the DIY Accounting VAT calculations. 
    **How do I get the add in?**
The add in is available in Excel.  On the Insert menu click on get Add Ins. A window called office add-ins will appear.  Type in VitalTax and click "add".  When using the tool, you will need to select “DIY Accounting – VAT” in the templates window.
