        <h2>Registering and Advantages Filing Self Assessment Tax Return Online</h2>
        <p>

          <span data-ref="REF018" class="ref-claim">required to register the business with HMRC</span> within three months of commencing
          trading. Following registration HMRC issue the unique tax payers reference and annually send out the self assessment tax return.

        <p>
          The printed paper tax return sent to HMRC should be identical in format to the official HMRC version of the paper return.

        <p><strong>Advantages Filing Self Assessment Tax Return Online</strong></p>
        <p>
          HMRC encourage filing self assessment tax return online as it streamlines their administration and carries advantages for the tax
          filing by self employed business enabling the online tax return to be processed quicker than the paper tax return. The HMRC tax
          calculator immediately calculates the national insurance and income tax liability and also offers the option to pay that tax
          liability online immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filing the self assessment tax return online also offers peace of mind as an email acknowledgement is received. HMRC do not issue
          receipts for paper returns Filing tax returns online can be done 24 hours a day and both the tax liability and payment history can
          be accessed and payments made if required to avoid <span data-ref="REF301" class="ref-claim">late payment fines</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A significant advantage of filing tax return online is the additional 3 months between the
          <span data-ref="REF019" class="ref-claim">paper tax return deadline at 31 October</span> and the
          <span data-ref="REF020" class="ref-claim">online tax return deadline 31 January</span>. This time gap can be used to review the
          self assessment return being submitted ensuring accuracy. Reviewing the tax return after preparation can often stimulate the
          memory of tax deductible expenses that may have been mislaid or forgotten which can then be deducted to reduce the final tax bill.
