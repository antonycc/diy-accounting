        <h2>Sole traders starting your own new sole trader business set up</h2>
        <p>
          Information for sole traders starting your own new sole trader business set up including how to start up business, basic accounts
          and easy accounting
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting up in business as a sole trader is the easiest way most businesses choose but some knowledge of how to start up business
          is useful. Every budding entrepreneur should be aware of the need to adequately prepare for the business venture. Administration
          and accounting is usually straightforward, you are your own boss and all the profits belong to the sole traders. By adopting an
          approach of researching the opportunity and getting the administration right from the start the chance of success of any new start
          up is increased, and that is important, as more new start up businesses go out of business leaving the sole trader with personal
          debts than survive in the first 3 years.
        </p>
        <p><strong>New Start Up with the Business name, Business plan and personal liability risk</strong></p>
        <p>
          The first point of how to start up business as a sole trader is the business set up you can use your own name or choose a suitable
          business name. All transactions would be conducted under the actual name of the sole trader or the actual name trading as the
          business name. The sole trader own name should be used on all business stationery, letters, invoices, receipts and cheques. As all
          liabilities incurred are the personal responsibility of the sole trader and there is no distinction between business assets and
          personal assets. Should the business incur losses, and that is quite common in the first year, all losses remain the personal
          liability of the sole trader. An important step to take before trading commences in the new business set up is to prepare a
          business plan. A business plan is essential for a new start up if funding is being sought but is also important since the first
          year trading performance can be difficult. The business plan consists of sales, purchases, investment in assets and a financial
          profit statement plus cash flow forecast.
        </p>
        <p>
          The major benefit initially to be obtained from the business plan is the research the sole trader conducts into such areas as
          competition, market research, suppliers, costs and funding requirements. A business plan is essential to raising start up finance.
        </p>
        <p><strong>HMRC registration, local authority licenses, retail change of use.</strong></p>
        <p>
          When the business set up is complete and trading starts, the date of the first sale or purchase is the new start up date,
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF018"
            >the sole trader then has a responsibility to register as self employed with HMRC<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF018">[1]</a></sup
            ></span
          >. If self employment is not registered within 3 months of trading commencing the sole trader may be fined £100 for failing to
          register on time. Following registration HMRC will send an annual self employed tax return which has to be completed each
          financial year. It is usually advisable to adopt the 5 April as the year end date and so the first year would be less than 12
          months trading. The self employed registration form can be obtained by telephoning HMRC or visiting and downloading the
          registration form direct from the HMRC website at HMRC starting up There is no requirement to register the business set up or
          business name with Companies House which is solely for limited companies. Depending upon the type of trade there may be a
          requirement to register the new start up business with the local authority where either an application for change of use of the
          premises might be required for a retail business and/or a local authority license required for the proposed trade such as a taxi
          driver license, child minder, restaurant or pet shop license. Sole traders need to contact the local authority to determine if a
          license is required while the business set up is being considered as to start trading without a required licence can cause
          problems.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Insurance and public liability</strong></p>
        <p>
          How to start up business as a sole trader includes consideration of insurance requirements. Employers liability insurance will be
          required if employees are employed, insurance specific to the trade may be advisable to offer protection from claims, public
          liability insurance may be required and is often essential in retail trades particularly if that trade also requires a local
          authority license.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Easy Accounting</strong></p>
        <p>
          While a sole trader does not have to keep formal accounts, basic accounts are required to enable the net taxable profit to be
          calculated with paperwork to support that calculation. Documentary evidence includes paperwork obtained from third parties such as
          sales records and receipts, purchase invoices and receipts and if maintained the business bank account. The sole trader easy
          accounting package by DIY Accounting provides basic accounts spreadsheets to record the financial transactions and produce an
          income and expenditure statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is preferable to maintain regular basic accounts as part of the financial control bearing in mind that all debts of the
          business are personal to the sole traders. By preparing monthly basic accounts cash flow can be managed more effectively and an
          estimate of future tax liability made. It is not essential to employ an accountant to prepare the sole trader accounts and the tax
          return. Employing an accountant has the advantages of saving time in preparing the accounts, tax return; professional advice on
          what expenses can be claimed including calculating the capital allowances. The disadvantage is the cost and that is the choice of
          the sole trade, possibly do the easy accounting yourself and justify the accountant fees against the savings produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tax returns, Income Tax and National Insurance</strong> Sole traders are assessed for income tax and national insurance on
          an annual basis based upon the self employed tax return everyone self employed must complete and send to the tax authority. HMRC
          issue tax returns in April each year which need to be completed and
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF019"
            >submitted by 31 October following the end of the financial year<sup><a href="../references.html#REF019">[2]</a></sup></span
          >. Tax returns filed online can be submitted with a financial
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF020"
            >submission date of 31 January<sup><a href="../references.html#REF020">[3]</a></sup></span
          >, some 10 months after the end of the financial year. There are 2 versions of the self employed tax return, The short tax return
          is completed if sales turnover is below the
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF001"
            >VAT threshold (currently £90,000)<sup><a href="../references.html#REF001">[4]</a></sup></span
          >
          and the more detailed full self employed tax return completed if sales exceeded the cut off point which for 2007-08 was also the
          level at which vat registration was required. The easy accounting for sole traders with a turnover of under £30,000 includes a
          summary of sales and expenses which is simpler than the detailed requirements. In calculating the tax payable HMRC deduct from the
          net taxable profit the personal tax allowance and calculate the
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF021"
            >income tax payable at the 20 per cent basic rate on profits up to the higher earnings threshold and 40 per cent on net earnings
            above the higher threshold<sup><a href="../references.html#REF021">[5]</a></sup></span
          >. Losses incurred in previous years can be offset against the net taxable profit. Self employed pay Class 2 National Insurance
          contributions, currently £3.45 per week (payable on profits above £12,570). Refunds, through the small exceptions rules, are
          possible if net taxable profits are very low. In addition self employed also pay Class 4 National Insurance, currently 9 per cent
          on net profit above the personal allowance and up to the primary threshold and 2 per cent above the national insurance primary
          threshold Following the financial year end on 5 April the income tax and national insurance calculated by HMRC must be
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF022"
            >paid in full by the following 31 January<sup><a href="../references.html#REF022">[6]</a></sup></span
          >. In addition HMRC also assess the liability for the next financial year and
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF023"
            >50 per cent is also payable on 31 January with the remaining 50 per cent payable by 31 July<sup
              ><a href="../references.html#REF023">[7]</a></sup
            ></span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Benefits and disadvantages of vat registration</strong> A new business start up as a sole trader does not involve
          compulsory registration for vat. If a business set up is unregistered for vat then the vat charged on purchases is treated in the
          accounts as a cost and vat is not added to the sales values. Businesses are required to register for vat when sales reach the
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF001"
            >VAT threshold, currently £90,000<sup><a href="../references.html#REF001">[8]</a></sup></span
          >. If sales are mainly to the public who cannot reclaim the vat charged then it is usually better to delay registration until the
          threshold is reached. Where sales are mainly to other vat registered businesses that can reclaim the vat the sole trader adds to
          the sales value then it may be appropriate to voluntarily register to enable the vat input charged on purchases to be reclaimed
          against the vat charged to customers. Vat registered business are required to keep audit trails of income and expenditure to
          support the vat returns. An easy accounting system is still feasible but has to be more formal than basic accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bank accounts</strong> One point to consider when a sole trader considers how to start up business is that they does not
          need to open a separate business account. If a specific business account is used then HMRC have a right to see the transactions
          through that business account as supporting evidence to the basic accounts and so bookkeeping records should be maintained. HMRC
          may ask to see a private account but they do not have a statutory right to do so. Since all banking transactions are the personal
          responsibility and liability of the sole trader if a separate business bank account is opened then it must state the name of the
          sole trader. Typically the bank account name would be Your Name trading as Business Name. The advantages of maintaining a separate
          business account are significant in keeping business and personal finances separate which cause problems if he new business start
          up money becomes confused with personal money. The disadvantages are business bank charges and being committed to declaring the
          details to HMRC should they ask. If the business is run honestly then that should not be a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payroll and Employees</strong> The status and business set up of a sole trader is not affected if employees are engaged as
          the sole trader is still self employed. If employees are engaged then the sole trader needs to register with HMRC as an employer
          and operate a PAYE scheme which involves calculating and deducting income tax and national insurance from employees gross pay,
          incurring the employers national insurance contribution, issuing payslips and keeping records of all employees and deductions.
          Income tax, employees and employers national insurance can be paid to HMRC quarterly if under £1500 per quarter or monthly if
          exceeding this level.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Networking with business groups</strong> There are numerous groups sole traders may consider joining. The government
          organisation Business Link offer free advice on many issues about how to start up business and may have business grants available
          for new start ups. Business Link also has contacts with local enterprise agencies who offer support. The Federation of Small
          Business charges an annual subscription, hold regular local meetings and provide a range of discounted services to small
          businesses.
