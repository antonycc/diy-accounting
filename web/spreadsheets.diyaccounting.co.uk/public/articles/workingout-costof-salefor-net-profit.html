        <h2>How Do I Work out the Cost of a Sale for Net Profit?</h2>
        <p>This article explains how to work out the Cost of Sale for Net Profit</p>
        <p>
          It's important to calculate the "cost of sale" figure in any business in order to work out the net profit and therefore provide an
          analysis of how the business is really doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, lets identify what these terms really mean. The <em>cost of sale</em> figure, for example, is defined as the wholesale
          cost of the product sold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>cost of sale</em> figure is found by finding total <em>income</em> minus the <em>cost of goods sold</em>.
          <em>Cost of goods sold</em> can be found by adding the <em>purchases</em> to the<em> starting stock</em> and subtracting the<em>
            finishing stock.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>The <em>gross profit</em> is found by using the <em>income</em> less the <em>cost of sale</em>.</p>
        <p>
          Working out cost of sale for <em>net profit</em> can be worked out by subtracting the <em>admin costs</em> from the
          <em>gross profit.</em> Working out the Cost of Sale figure to calculate your Net Profit: Cost of Sale = (Purchases + Starting
          stock) - Finishing stock
        </p>
        <p>Gross Profit = Income - Cost of Sale Net profit = Gross profit - Admin costs Example -</p>
        <p>Stock increasing: £30,000 + (£20,000 - £10,000) - £10,000 = £30,000 profit</p>
        <p>Stock the same: £30,000 + (£10,000 - £10,000) - £10,000 = £20,000 profit</p>
        <p>Stock decreasing: £30,000 + (£10,000 - £20,000) - £10,000 = £10,000 profit</p>
