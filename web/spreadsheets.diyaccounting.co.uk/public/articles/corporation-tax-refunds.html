        <p>This article explains how to input a transaction for Corporation Tax Refunds</p>
        <p>
          <span class="ref" data-ref="REF064"
            >Every company which is liable to corporation tax should fill out the Company Tax Return for each accounting period even if you
            don't owe any corporation tax or are due a refund<sup><a href="../references.html#REF064">[1]</a></sup></span
          >. If you are due a refund you can choose how this is repaid; either straight away or this can be carried forward to the next
          accounting year. If you have received a Corporation Tax refund relating to a previous year, you will follow the below steps: You
          would process the actual rebate payment as a negative amount in currentaccount.xls (payments section) If the Rebate related to a
          previous years taxation, to make this balance with your corporation tax liability you'll have to make the same adjustment to the
          corporation tax liability section in financialaccounts > openaccounts. For example -
        </p>
        <p>
          Lets say in your 2011-12 you had a £3000 tax liability and had already paid £2000 towards this before the 2012-13 year started.
        </p>
        <p>Open accounts would show the £1000 liability.</p>
        <p>If later for whatever reason there recalculation and the 2011-12 liability was reduced from £3000 to £500:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You would be due £1500 back which would be entered in currentaccount > payments (as a negative)</li>
          <li>You would adjust the financialaccounts > open accounts to have a tax liability of -£1500</li>
          <li>Any remaining corporation tax liability would be only from current the 2011-12 year.</li>
        </ol>
