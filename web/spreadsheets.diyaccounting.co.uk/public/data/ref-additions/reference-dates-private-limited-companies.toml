# Citation references for reference-dates-private-limited-companies.html
# New references: REF339, REF340, REF341, REF342, REF343, REF344, REF345, REF346
# Reused: REF182 — add "reference-dates-private-limited-companies" to articles list
# NOTE: Article contains several outdated figures:
#   - Says "22 months" for first accounts filing; current GOV.UK says 21 months
#   - Says "10 months" for subsequent accounts; current GOV.UK says 9 months
#   - Says "form 225" for changing ARD; now done online or via form AA01
#   - Penalty amounts (£100/£250/£500/£1000) are outdated; current are £150/£375/£750/£1,500
# References cite current GOV.UK sources so readers can verify the up-to-date position.
