| 2026-27 | 100% | 14% | 12,000 | 3,000 | `se-2026-2027.toml` |

Notes:
- AIA is stored as 1.00 (100%) in TOML. The monetary limit (£1,000,000 since Jan 2019, made permanent April 2023) is not stored in the spreadsheet — the AIA cell represents the percentage rate applied.
- WDA main pool rate was 18% from April 2012 until March 2026. Reduced to 14% from April 2026.
- Motor vehicle cost threshold (£12,000) and restriction (£3,000) are specific to the spreadsheet's simplified treatment of expensive cars. HMRC's actual threshold for special rate pool cars is based on CO2 emissions since April 2021.
