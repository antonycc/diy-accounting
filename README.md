# diy-accounting

This is the home of DIY Accounting's community edition spreadsheet based packages. Formerly, these DIY Accounting 
spreadsheets were distributed as a set of proprietary products, owned by DIY Accounting Limited and created by 
Terry Cartwright in the early 2000s. The spreadsheets are now Open Source and released under the Mozilla Public 
License Version 2.0. See: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/  

# The relationship to DIY Accounting Limited
